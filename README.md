This is a destination finder program that primarily allows hotel owners to search for tourist destinations in specific locations based on user input, to help find local suggestions on a customers' request. 

The application works by obtaining the current location from the user, retrieves the latitude and longitude of the area for precise mapping from OpenCage API, and retrieves locations of interest near to the user's choice using Foursquare API. 

The application utilises an SQLite database. Hotel owners can signup and login to search locations, which saves their individual history of all locations discovered from their searches. Hotel owners can see which suggestions are the most popular. Hotel owners can also search in guest mode without logging in. 

Hotel owners can select any number of pre-defined categories (or none) to refine their search results.
