This is a destination finder program that primarily allows users to search for tourist destinations in specific locations based on user input.

The application works by obtaining the current location from the user, retrieves the latitude and longitude of the area for precise mapping from OpenCage API, and retrieves locations of interest near to the user's choice using Foursquare API. 

The application utilises an SQLite database. Users can signup and login to search locations, which saves their individual history of all locations discovered from their searches. Users can also search in guest mode without logging in.

Users can select any number of pre-defined categories (or none) to refine their search results.
